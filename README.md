# EthereumEG Improvement Proposals (EEGIP)

The EEGIP repository provides guidelines and standards applicable to both the Ethereum Event Gardeners (EthereumEG or EEG) community and the broader (Ethereum) event ecosystem, encompassing hackathons, conferences, meetups, and other gatherings. These standards are captured in documents referred to as **Ethereum Event Gardeners Improvement Proposals** (EEGIPs). The methodology for submitting and documenting these proposals is outlined in [EEGIP-1](./EEGIPS/eegip-1.md).
