# EthereumEG Improvement Proposals (EEGIP)

The goal of the EEGIP project is to standardize and provide high-quality documentation for Ethereum Event Gardeners (EthereumEG or EEG) itself and conventions built upon it. This repository tracks past and ongoing improvements in the form of Ethereum Event Gardeners Improvement Proposals (EEGIPs). [EEGIP-1](./EEGIPS/eegip-1.md) governs how EEGIPs are published.
